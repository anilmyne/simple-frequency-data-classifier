Non-highly-mathematical AI
This is a project imported from Python to C++.
Currently not well coded but works.
How to use;
There are 2 header files "margins.hpp" and "algorithms.hpp" and the code file "marginer.cpp".
This specific code shows how to use a marginer to classify color in images
Margins.hpp contains a class called iCom that performs the classifications. 
A description of how this code works will be uploaded sometime.
